It is not Switches that have link-layer addresses, but their interfaces.  Thus, a single switch would properly
have a different address for each interface, and so a switch should have a dictionary of interfaces, indexed by address
(just an integer, an interface id, for example).  The link layer interface could be its own object, and could do the
translation from link layer frames to physical bits and send them out on the connection.

Routers have an ARP module, which holds an ARP table for translation between link layer (MAC) and network layer (IP)
addresses within a given subnet. IP Address    MAC Address   TTL (when entry will be deleted, typically 20min)

However, this table is initially empty.  It is populated via the exchange of ARP packets containing (at least):
(Example query packet)
Src IP  Src MAC  Dst IP  Dst MAC
1       1        2       0 (Broadcast)

Routers use these to ask all link layer interfaces in the subnet for a MAC address not known in the router's ARP table.
Obviously, the only valid choice of MAC address to send the ARP packets to is the broadcast address (i.e. address to
everyone).  Interfaces recieving these broadcasted ARP packets pass them up to their ARP modules.  If their IP is the
Dst IP, they reply by filling the Dst MAC field, and returning the ARP packet to sender.

Sending an ARP packet is the first step in sending a network datagram to an IP address whose MAC address is not known.
