    Rhys's Notes - Rough Outline

    For this bit, I'm assuming messages are not threads, because that idea is inconsistent with
    this approach.

    It must be assumed that the GUI thread has the power/authority/priority to preempt the
    thread running this loop in order to make changes to the network object.  I imagine this as
    a simple stop flag that the simulation thread checks every time a cycle is completed.  If the
    stop flag is set, the simulation thread should terminate.  This is okay if all modifications
    to the network, including creation/update/deletion of messages, are stored within the global
    network object, and so the network's state is saved.

    This way, the GUI can make whatever changes are needed while the simulation is halted, and then
    spawn a new thread to take up the simulation again once modifcations are complete.  This could
    probably be modified in a straightforward way to allow modifcation while appearing not to interrupt
    the simulation.


    What does the simulation loop do?:

        Iterates through all network entities and advances them one tick into the future.
        Since nodes and connections don't DO anything right now, this will pretty much
        solely involve moving messages around and deleting them once they reach their
        destinations.

    How is a message created?

        I'm currently assuming that the simulation thread doesn't create messages, the GUI thread does.
        This would simply mean setting the stop flag, then accessing the (thread-safe) network object
        and adding new messages at the nodes they are starting from.  Easy-peasy.

    What is a message?

        Properly, a message/packet is a nested object with a hierarchy like so:

        Message carried by Segment carried by Datagram carried by Frame

        Segment has transport layer header, which should specify source and destination port numbers, at the very least.
        Datagram has network layer header, which should specify source and destination IP addresses, at the very least.
        Frame  has link layer header, which should specify source and destination MAC addresses, at the very least.

        For the first sprint, however, it is reasonable to ignore some of the complexity of this picture
        and instead collapse this three layer addressing scheme to a single layer.  So going forward I will
        assume we are only dealing with host level communication, and so I only need to deal with port numbers
        (basically pretending they are IP addresses).

        Thus, I shall deal with messages of the form

        Message carried by Segment

        And that's it, for now.

    How does a message move around?

        A message must be associated with (located at) a node somehow. I have created a Packet class to accomplish this.

        Given this, we proceed as follows:

        Step 1: Where to go?
            Simple Scenario (First Sprint)
                - If the message is at a node:
                    - call node's forward(message) method to determine where the message should move to next.
                    - forward(message) must return the connection along which the message should be sent.
                    - Since there will only be routing in the first sprint, this will be provided by Navjot.
                - Set the message's current connection to the returned connection.

            More Realistic Scenario (Second Sprint)
                - If the message is at a layer three device
                    - call the node's route(message) method, which returns the next connection the message should use.
                    - this will be determined based on the network layer header.
                - If the message is at a layer two device
                    - call the node's forward(message) method which returns the next connection the message should use.
                    - Here, we will use the link layer header info to determine this, so this is not necessarily the
                      same as the routing algorithm Navjot is doing.
                - Either way, set the message's current connection to the one returned.

        Step 2: How long to take?
            - Look up the specified connection in the global network object (thank you, Barry).
                Simple Scenario (First Sprint):
                    - Connection will specify a single delay value
                    - Set countdown to this delay value (to be decremented each cycle until it reaches zero)
                    - When countdown is zero, update message location to the node at the other end of the connection

                More Realistic Scenario (Second Sprint):
                    - The connection should specify, in some way
                        - transmission delay (time to push the packet out onto the connection)
                            - probably just a straight up value in arbitrary time units
                        - propagation delay (time for packet to traverse the link)
                            - issue 8 specifies "medium" and "length" fields, which combine to determine this.
                - With this info we do the following:
                    - set a countdown to the transmission delay (to be decremented every cycle until it reaches zero)
                        - during this time, another message can not be transmitted down this connection
                    - when counton is zero, set another countdown to the propogation delay (again decrement each cycle)
                        -during this time, another message may be transmitted down this connection
                    - when countdown is zero, update message location to the device on the other end of the connection.


        Step 3: Where to now?
            If the message has reached it's final destination, the message is pushed up the network stack within the
            host, unwrappy stuff happens and the message is delivered to the currently imaginary application layer.  This
            comes under Jeremy's purview, as he is writing the Host, Router, and Switch classes.

            If we still have a ways to go, see Step 1.

        There is a small fly in the ointment here, in that logic may or may not need to be implemented to prevent
        more than one message from using a given connection simultaneously.  For the first sprint, this will be ignored.
